Implementation of RUDP [Taken from Wikipedia]:
----------------------------------------------
In order to ensure quality, it extends UDP by means of adding the following features:

1. Acknowledgment of received packets
2. Windowing and flow control
3. Retransmission of lost packets
4. Overbuffering (Faster than real-time streaming)

RUDP is not currently a formal standard, however it was described in an IETF internet-draft in 1999. It has not been proposed for standardization.
